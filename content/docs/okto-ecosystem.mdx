## What is Okto?

Okto is a comprehensive orchestration layer designed to simplify the complex world of blockchain technology. Our goal is to make Web3 more accessible by addressing common challenges such as:
- Chain abstraction
- Account management
- Transaction handling
- Fee management

By tackling these issues, Okto helps both users and developers navigate the Web3 space more easily.

## Background & Motivation

Web3 promises decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment. However, mainstream adoption stalls when everyday users struggle with:

- Complex wallet management (private keys, multiple seed phrases)
- Gas fees in different native tokens
- Bridging liquidity from chain to chain
- Fragmented developer experiences across multiple networks

Okto was formed to bridge this gap—combining powerful crypto primitives with a developer-friendly “abstraction layer” that seamlessly supports multiple blockchains. Ultimately, Okto aims to make blockchain interactions as easy as “click and done,” so that dApps can onboard users without friction.
